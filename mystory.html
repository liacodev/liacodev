    <h1>My Story</h1>
    <h2>Creating with purpose. Building with passion. Living with intention.</h2>
 <p>Curiosity has always been my compass. After graduating with a degree in Business Management, I’ve taken a hands-on approach to exploring different fields—interior design, French pâtisserie, and gemology—each driven by my desire to create, build, and bring ideas to life. I’ve launched small businesses, crafted with my own hands, and learned to balance beauty with function and entrepreneurship.
    Originally from the Philippines, I moved to Japan in search of new experiences and found myself working as a business English coach and a college teacher. While I valued my time in education, I felt a growing pull toward something more creative and technical—something that would allow me to keep building and innovating.
    That journey led me to web development, where I finally discovered the perfect blend of logic, design, and purpose. Today, I’m focused on becoming a software engineer, using both creative thinking and technical skills to build tools, platforms, and experiences that make a meaningful impact.</p>
